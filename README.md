# R-ssorted-Data
Hi, I picked up some R and ML practice at my sequencing job. Of the available options, I picked up R because it has alot of interesting metaprogramming and convenience built into it. It's really good for data science since it has loose types and I got pretty comfortable with pipes over the past few months since I started!


There's also some Jupiter notebooks about Image Classification and stuff in there, but they're just schoolwork, compared to the R files. I haven't yet gotten to the part where I may apply machine learning to the biological sequences I'm working with as of writing.
